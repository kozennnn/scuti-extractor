### Installation

The Scuti extractor is really easy to install with just a few commands.
You can start by copying the example configuration:
```shell
cp configuration.example.json configuration.json
```

After copying it, you can change the path to the assets that you want to convert.

Then you can install the dependencies:
```shell
npm install
```

And run the extractor!
```shell
npm run start
```

This will give you an output folder with all the extracted assets. The output directory structure follows the one used in [scuti-resources](https://github.com/kozennnn/scuti-resources). So if you want to use these assets into your project, just clone the scuti-resources repository and paste the extracted resources in it.
